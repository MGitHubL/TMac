# TMac

This is the code for the paper "TMac: Temporal Multi-Modal Graph Learning for Acoustic Event Classification" on ACM MM 2023, which we will update soon.

This code is based on X improvements, you can get the original code from here: https://github.com/AmirSh15/VAED_HeterGraph

Download the dataset form here: [data](https://livewarwickac-my.sharepoint.com/personal/u1880714_live_warwick_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fu1880714%5Flive%5Fwarwick%5Fac%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2FVisually%2Daware%20Acoustic%20Event%20Detection%20using%20Heterogeneous%20Graphs%20Paper%2FProcessed%20AudioSet&ga=1)
